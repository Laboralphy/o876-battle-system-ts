/**
 * Adds a new damage type to a weapon.
 * Weapon with multiple damage types are less likely to hit the target. But when they hit they might deal more damage
 * by circumventing the resistance of the target.
 * For example: A target like ooze with crushing damage resistance will be hard to kill with a warhammer, but
 * will be killable with a bec de corbin (crushing + piercing damage) ; because the most efficient of the damage type
 * will be used to deal the most damage.
 * However when it comes to compute if a target is hit by a weapon, the best armor class is used against all damage types
 * provided by a weapon.
